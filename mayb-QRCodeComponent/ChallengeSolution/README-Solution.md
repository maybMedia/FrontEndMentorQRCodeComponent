## Overview

This is my solution to the QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor, it is the first challenge I have completed and I am certain that I have not used the most efficient methods to produce this solution.

## My process

I utilised my prior knowledge of html and css though my limited experience with flexbox led me to search github & StackOverflow to solve the issues I had.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Google Font API

### What I learned

I am now more comfortable with the use of Flexboxes and positioning of elements. This was a simple task and I am satisfied with the knowledge I have developed with the completion of the challenge. 

I previously would not have known to use nested divs to center an element on the page like below:

```HTML
  <div class="container">
    <div class="qr">
      <img src="images/image-qr-code.png"/>
      <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      <div class="attribution">
        Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. 
        Coded by <a href="https://github.com/maybMedia">mayb</a>.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

### Continued development

I want to learn to use grid and flexbox for their respective purposes.

### Useful resources

- [How to vertically center a DIV using Flexbox - ccTuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjZGLKCCqY) - This helped me understand flexboxes and how to use them in order to center elements vertically which can scale based on the window size.
- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This tool allowed me to generate the box shadow displayed below the element.
